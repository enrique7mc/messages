Simple Chat Application

This app is built with React JS for the presentation layer
and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store data and user login information.

Also uses Flux to coordinate the pass of data between components
after an event is triggered by the user.

The source code is written in ES6 and
includes few features of ES7 like decorators.
